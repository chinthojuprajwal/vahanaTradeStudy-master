# vahana-open-source
This repository contains the Matlab source code and results corresponding to the configuration trade study blog posts on our website at [vahana.aero](https://vahana.aero) which is modified to run ATC optimisation. This study optimises the cost per flight or the overall mass of the system by modelling wing, gearbox, propeller and the motor. The following models are used for modelling these subsystems
1. Wing : Constant lift theory
2. Gearbox : torque based sizing
3. Motor : torque based sizing and efficiency-RPM-torque map
4. Propeller : Blade element momentum theory or actuator disk theory
